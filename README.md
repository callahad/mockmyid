MockMyID
========

MockMyID was a Mozilla Persona Identity Provider (IdP) that gladly issued identity certificates to anyone and everyone, without a second thought.

It was like Mailinator, for Persona.

(All email sent to mockmyid.com addresses is delivered and readable at mailinator.com!)

MockMyID made it easy to test and demo sites that used Persona.

How Do I Use It?
----------------

Whenever you're asked to log in with Persona, just make up any email address you want `@mockmyid.com`.
