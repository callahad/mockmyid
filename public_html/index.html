    <h1>Welcome to MockMyID.com</h1>

    <p>MockMyID was a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/persona">Mozilla Persona</a> Identity Provider (IdP) that would gladly issue assertions to anyone and everyone, without a second thought.</p>

    <p>It was like <a href="http://mailinator.com">Mailinator</a>, for Persona.</p>

    <p>(All email sent to mockmyid.com addresses is delivered and readable at <a href="http://mailinator.com">Mailinator</a>!)</p>

    <p>MockMyID made it easy to test and demo sites that use Persona.</p>

    <h2>How Could I Have Used It?</h2>

    <p>Whenever you were asked to log in with Persona, you could just make up any email address you want <code>@mockmyid.com</code>.</p>

    <h2>Where's the Code?</h2>

    <p>At <a href="https://github.com/callahad/mockmyid">github.com/callahad/mockmyid</a>.</p>
